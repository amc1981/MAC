Later I joined the distributed systems operations team of the same group of companies.\n\nIn 2019 I left the operations department to join the Platform Assurance team as a support technician for the development teams of the e-commerce websites (elcortingles.es, hipercor.es, sfera.com, primeriti.es, etc.). At the same time being a systems technician for the development environments and infrastructure project manager for the new developments that the client needed.\n\nSince then I have been dedicated in various stages to DevOps and DevSecOps support teams, working in the administration of Openshift and ELK platforms, or helping with the implementation of new CI/CD flows for the development teams.\n\nIn April 2024, I obtained the Atlassian ACP-620 certification for project management with Jira Software Cloud.",

It was my first assignment when I arrived at the Platform Assurance department. We had to automate the production data loading processes in this \"non-production\" environment.\n\nThe challenge was that while the production infrastructure was on-premise, the infrastructure for this business environment was in the cloud. Therefore, we had to use ad hoc processes first to perform the loading and then to tune the catalog loading and indexing processes in the business environment. As we had much less computing power and latency problems between the client's CPD and the Azure cloud, in addition to the ad hoc bash developments, we had to orchestrate actions with different systems and communications groups to make the relevant adjustments.\n\nAfter 6 months of learning, we managed to deliver the environment and operate it from the department to carry out the data uploads necessary for each campaign. Today, the environment is still operational and has been developed by other colleagues who succeeded me in the department, thanks to the documentation we left at the time.",
